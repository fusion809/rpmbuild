Fri Aug 15 11:04:07 CEST 2003 - mfabian@suse.de

- adapt vim-6.2-gvimrc-fontset.dif to the settings needed for
  a gtk2 build. For most languages it is OK to set "guifontset"
  to "monospace". But for Korean "monospace" expands to
  "Baekmuk Gulim" with our current default settings and
  this results in a very wide, broken spacing between the letters.
  As this effect happens with many CJK fonts and the Latin glyphs
  in many CJK fonts are ugly, set a good Latin font as the default
  for CJK. This latin font is automatically combined with the
  appropriate CJK font according to the rules in
  /etc/fonts/fonts.conf. I choose "Luxi\ Mono" because this
  is guaranteed to be installed always.

Sun Mar 10 16:36:46 CET 2002 - mfabian@suse.de

- fix typo in entry for Korean fontset which prevented the
  gulim fonts from being used

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  4 18:08:40 CET 2002 - mfabian@suse.de

- change default fontset entry for Korean to prevent core dump
  in Korean locale. 
  Our previous default selected was 
  guifontset=-*-clean-bold-r-*--16-*-*-*-*-*-*-*,
             -*-gulim-medium-r-*--16-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
  but since XFree86 4.2.0 the 'clean-bold' pattern doesn't
  match any iso8859-1 font anymore. Now it matches only:
  -schumacher-clean-bold-r-normal--16-160-75-75-c-80-iso646.1991-irv
  Because of this 'gvim' can't get any usable font, and
  gui.char_width becomes 0. This leads to a division by 0
  in function gui_resize_shell().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  3 17:52:13 CET 2002 - mfabian@suse.de

- add xim.diff from "Yasuhiro Matsumoto" <mattn_jp@hotmail.com>
